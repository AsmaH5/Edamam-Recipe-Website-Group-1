# Edamam-Recipe-Website-Group-1

USER STORY:
As a health-conscious individual who loves to cook, I want to be able to easily search for recipes that not only taste great but also align with my nutritional needs.

I want a recipe website that I can enter in my dietary preferences and any allergies I have, and the recipes will be filtered accordingly.

When I select a recipe I am able to see the calorie information plus fat, carb and protein content of the recipe.

Once I have found a recipe that I like, I can view the full ingredients list and step-by-step instructions, along with any necessary nutritional information, to ensure that I am cooking a healthy and delicious meal.

I would also separately to the recipes like to be able to search the nutritional value of individual ingredients and have the results given back to me calculated as part of my daily allowance.


## Description

Happy Tummy is a recipe website that helps health-conscious individuals find healthy and delicious recipes that fit their dietary needs.

- The motivation for developing Happy Tummy came from our personal experience of struggling to find healthy and delicious recipes that fit individual dietary needs. We found that many recipe websites lacked the option to look up the nutritional values of ingredients and that searching for specific recipes could be time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to create a website that would solve these problems and help people like us find healthy and tasty recipes with ease.

- Despite the challenges of working on this project remotely we were able to effectively communicate as a team via slack and supported each other when issues came up. We had to communicate frequently to ensure that we were all on the same page and working towards the same goals. We also learned the value of good code management practices and how it can help avoid conflicts and delays.

Secondly, we gained a deeper understanding of web development technologies, specifically APIs and JavaScript. We learned how to use these languages to build a functional and visually appealing website, and how to integrate APIs to enhance the user experience.
