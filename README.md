# Edamam-Recipe-Website-Group-1

USER STORY:
As a health-conscious individual who loves to cook, I want to be able to easily search for recipes that not only taste great but also align with my nutritional needs.

I want a recipe website that I can enter in my dietary preferences and any allergies I have, and the recipes will be filtered accordingly.

When I select a recipe I am able to see the calorie information plus fat, carb and protein content of the recipe.

Once I have found a recipe that I like, I can view the full ingredients list and step-by-step instructions, along with any necessary nutritional information, to ensure that I am cooking a healthy and delicious meal.

I can even save my favourite recipes for future reference or share them with friends and family who also prioritise health and nutrition.

I would also separately to the recipes like to be able to search the nutritional value of individual ingredients and have the results given back to me calculated as part of my daily allowance.
